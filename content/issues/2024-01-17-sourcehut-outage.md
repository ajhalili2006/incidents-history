**Update as of 2024-01-17 14:21**: A few days ago, we observed that SourceHut is experiencing
a network outage, through @ajhalili2006 attempting to accessing chat.sr.ht and through the
daily.dev feeds. Even through the issue has been resolved, we're still monitoring the situtation
as platform users for few more days.
